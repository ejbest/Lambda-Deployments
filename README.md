# Lambda-Deployments

### Under Construction and not "ready to run"

This is designed to take a attribute file of details and deploy "applicaitons" to AWS Lambda 

There is pieces to make this deploy to Lambda with a Virtual Gateway and S3 bucket 

The next steps is to add a automated test using Selenium 

There also is a missing Jenkinfile to be replaced here as well.

Please let me know any questions; if any details are missing or if anything was interpreted incorrectly.
